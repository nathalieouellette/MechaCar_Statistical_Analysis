AutosRUs' newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking manufacturing team's progress. Review production data for insights that might help manufacturing team

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The linear model that is being used to determine the statistically difference in each variable is shown in figure 1. 
The intercept, ground clearance, and vehicle length were the lowest possibility to provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset as shown in figure 2. 
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. It is impossible for a graph to be created due to the number of variables used and dimensions. They are impossible to plot more than 3 variables, which this model has, on a graph.
This linear model does not predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. This is due to the fact that the intercept is statistically significant. When a intercept is statistically significant, there are other variables and factors that are statiscally signifiant that has not been included in the model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

In your description, address the following questions:

What metric or metrics are you going to test?

What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

What data is needed to run the statistical test?
